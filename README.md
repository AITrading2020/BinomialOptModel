# BinomialOptModel
This is a simple python program to implement the Binomial Option Pricing Model.
## Prerequisites
The only python module needed is numpy.
```python
import numpy as np
```
It is possible to do this without the numpy module, but dealing with matrices becomes very tedious without numpy.
## Binomial Option Pricing Model
Now let me explain the theory behind the model.
